description: "'Our challenge is to visit places that others have already been to, then figure out how to interpret the landscape in a unique way, make it our own. The one ingredient adventure does need is the element of the unknown - the sense that what you might find, and whether you will be successful in your mission, hangs in the fog of uncertainty.'"
